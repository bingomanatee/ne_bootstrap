Note that it is quite possible to NOT have many of the above features; \n\n* A REST action will not have a view file or a static directory. \n* Many actions will not need specific client side files, and won't need a static directory.","creator":"bingomanatee","name":"actions","scope":"nuby_express","summary":"A response to one or more specific URLs","title":"Actions","write_date":"2012-10-21T04:38:10.106Z","scope_root":false,"deleted":false}
