While I think its not really sensible to assert that one is absolutely better than another, you can at least put forth the features of a given system that appeal to you. \n\nThere is a lot of enthusiasm for DRY methodology, subsumed by systems like CoffeScript, SASS et.al. As noble as they are, they cross a line that I don't particularly like being crossed: they make it possible for a whitespace-related issue to screw you. \n\nCoding has a long history of useful bracketing; for me, indent-based coding throws out a convention that has a huge history of success in multiple implementations. This is in fact one of the things I find unreadable in Ruby; so much of the structure is implied rather than documented. It is really tough for instance to match a given `end` tag with its mate. \n\nI find coding systems to be dangerously abstracted when it is significantly difficult to match an end product with its originating source. Any good code platform should recognize that being debuggable is the first and most important measure of its worth.","author":"bingomanatee","creator":"bingomanatee","write_date":"2012-10-24T16:11:19.582Z","_id":"nuby_express:why_ejs","__v":1,"scope_root":false,"deleted":false}
