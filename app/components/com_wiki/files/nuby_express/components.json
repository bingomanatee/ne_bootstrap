{"__v":3,"_id":"nuby_express:components","author":"bingomanatee","content":"Components are self-sufficient bundles of resources and controllers. Components in Nuby Express fulfill the same role as modules in node.js. Like node modulees, they contain all the resources they need (more or less) to serve a specific niche activity in your site: managing members, processing layouts, the wiki you are reading, etc. \n\nIts worth noting that the [[frameworks:Root Framework]] is itself a Component with extra functionality, so everything in this page applies to frameworks as well as components. \n\n## Contents of Components\n\n* A component can contain any number of [[controllers:Controllers]]. Controllers are contained in a subfolder named `controllers`*\n* A [[resources:Resources Folder]] (`resources`) containing any number of resources, organized in type folders, as in `con_admin/resources/models/options_model.js` or `com_layout/resources/view_helpers/js_view_helper.js`. \n* A configuration file, `config.json`; it acts as a default [[action_config:action configuration]] for all actions in the component.\n* folders for `tests` or `node_modules`. The former is not a formal part of NE - its' not actually loaded by any part of the framework (yet...). The latter contains any modules required by any part of the component. It is good practice to completely bundle all NPM modules that the component requires rather than relating to any globally installed modules. \n--------\n<small>* alternately, they can also be placed singly in the component, as long as their folder begins with the \"con_\" prefix, as in `con_home` or `con_admin`.</small>","creator":"bingomanatee","name":"components","scope":"nuby_express","summary":"Web modules; contain all the tools necessary for a specific solution.","title":"Components","write_date":"2012-10-21T03:41:45.883Z","scope_root":false,"deleted":false}
