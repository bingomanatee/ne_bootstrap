{"__v":1,"_id":"nuby_express:method","author":"bingomanatee","content":"All requests have a method. The commonly accepted REST verbs are:\n\n* __GET__: get requests' manifests are defiend wholly by their URL; get requests do not contain encoded parameters, unlike __PUT__ and __POST__ requests. In REST, get requests signify requests for existing data - either aggregate requests for entire collections or specific requests for single records. \n* __POST__: post requests contain encoded name-value pairs, as is typical of a form post where the form fields' values are identified by the names of the fields. in REST, POST requests are intended to create new records. \n* __PUT__: Structurally identical to POST; however in REST , put is designed to *update* existing records. \n* __DELETE__: in REST, sends a signal to remove a specific records or (gasp!) an entire collection. \n\nNote -- see [[sending_rest_data_from_forms]] for a hack to interpret form data into all four REST methods.","creator":"bingomanatee","name":"method","scope":"nuby_express","summary":"A property of all http requests - the \"verb\" of a request.","title":"Request/REST method","write_date":"2012-10-21T03:15:42.912Z","scope_root":false,"deleted":false}
