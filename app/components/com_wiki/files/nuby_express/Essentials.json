{"__v":1,"_id":"nuby_express:Essentials","author":"bingomanatee","content":"Nuby Express sites are built on the classic MVC hierarchy, with a different perspective: \n\n## Action folders\n\n[[actions:Actions]] are self-contained folders containing:\n\n*  a  [[action_static_folder:Static file folder]] for client side resources like JS, CSS and Images\n*  a server side [[action_script:: Node.js script(action.js)]]\n* an [[action_config:Action configuration file (config.json)]]\n\n## Controller folders\n\nUnlike most MVC apps, there is no \"controller file\" per se- rather, actions are contained within a [[controllers:Controller folder]] that contains a [[controller_config:configuration file(config.json)]] that acts as a \"default configuration\" for all its actions.\n\n## Component folders\n\n[[components:Components]] have a special role in Nuby Express. A Component is a self-contained bundle of resources for a web application, just like a module is a self-contained code library in node.  Component folders contain the following:\n\n* A folder for controllers\n* A [[resources:Resource Folder]] for extensions such as [[model_resource:Model resources]], [[view_helpers:View Helpers]] and other custom code components. \n* Optionally, a node_module folder for node modules, a test folder for your unit tests. \n* A [[component_config:configuration file]] for the component.","creator":"bingomanatee","linked_from":[],"name":"Essentials","scope":"nuby_express","summary":"The building blocks of Nuby Express","title":"Essentials","write_date":"2012-10-20T18:14:58.660Z","scope_root":false,"deleted":false}
