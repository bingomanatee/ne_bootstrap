View templates are [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) files.\n\nNote that the action file only \"kicks in\" if the [[action_script:Action script]] calls `on_output`. rs.send() sends your data raw as JSON and sidesteps any postprocessing, including the template and any [[view_helpers:View Helpers]]. \n\nNote that you are not restricted to just putting static and objects into the template; you can pass functions as well, and many existing view helpers do just that.","creator":"bingomanatee","name":"action_view_template","scope":"nuby_express","summary":"The EJS template for an action's view","title":"action view_template","write_date":"2012-10-21T02:26:18.971Z","scope_root":false,"deleted":false}
